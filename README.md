# Which should you use?
This project was inspired by my collegue which stated that:
<br>
> *"Creation of `List<T>` is expensive, you should __ALWAYS__ use `Collection<T>`"*  

So I decided to put it into test with excellent **BenchmarkDotNet** library.

* [List<T> vs Collection<T>](WhichYouShouldUse/ListVsCollection/Results.md)  
WIP:
* Method group vs lambda (as on http://vibrantcode.com/2013/02/19/lambdas-vs-method-groups/)
